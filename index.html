        <p>My name is Melvin, and I'm a former <em>IT Admin</em> turned <em>Web Developer</em>.  My journey to computers started at a young age when I became frustrated that Microsoft didn't include the ability to password protect your folders, and I wrote a batch file script to check against a string so that certain files could be password protected.  I used batch files to do some other things for me, like using logic trees to automate some basic windows functionalities.  The next step came in College where I was specializing in the CISCO IOs, which involves a terminal interface with a CISCO machine and writing config files for it.  I found the interaction at such a binary level to be very <strong>satisfying</strong> and not long after working for a year I switched fields.  I started coding on my own using <a href="freecodecamp.com">freecodecamp.com</a> as a starting point, learning <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em> and <em>JavaScript</em>.  After learning on my own for a bit, I decided to use a bootcamp to give myself more structured and challenging learning through <a href="epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>, where I learned Angular.JS, EmberJS, .NET, and some more advanced JavaScript and algorithm practice.  After this, I gained an internship at <a href="http://chalkdoc.com/">chalkdoc.com</a> where I build a Math Quiz application in Angular from scratch.</p>
